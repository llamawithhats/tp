## Setting Up

### Setting up the project in your computer

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning"><span class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle" aria-hidden="true"></span> <strong>Caution:</strong>
Follow the steps in the following guide precisely. Things will not work out if you deviate in some steps.
</div>

First, **fork** this repo, and **clone** the fork into your computer.

If you plan to use Intellij IDEA (highly recommended):

1. **Configure the JDK**: Follow the guide [_[se-edu/guides] IDEA: Configuring the JDK_](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/intellijJdk.html) to ensure Intellij is configured to use **JDK 17**.
1. **Import the project as a Gradle project**: Follow the guide [_[se-edu/guides] IDEA: Importing a Gradle project_](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/intellijImportGradleProject.html) to import the project into IDEA.<br>
   ⚠️ Note: Importing a Gradle project is slightly different from importing a normal Java project.
1. **Verify the setup**:
   1. Run the `seedu.address.Main` and try a few commands.
   1. [Run the tests](Testing.md) to ensure they all pass.

### Before writing code

1. **Configure the coding style**

   If using IDEA, follow the guide [_[se-edu/guides] IDEA: Configuring the code style_](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/intellijCodeStyle.html) to set up IDEA's coding style to match ours.

   <div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary"><span class="fas fa-lightbulb" aria-hidden="true"></span> <strong>Tip:</strong>
   Optionally, you can follow the guide [_[se-edu/guides] Using Checkstyle_](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/checkstyle.html) to find how to use the CheckStyle within IDEA e.g., to report problems _as_ you write code.
   </div>

1. **Set up CI**

   This project comes with a GitHub Actions config files (in `.github/workflows` folder). When GitHub detects those files, it will run the CI for your project automatically at each push to the `master` branch or to any PR. No set up required.

1. **Learn the design**

   When you are ready to start coding, we recommend that you get some sense of the overall design by reading about [TutorTrack's architecture](DeveloperGuide.md#architecture).

1. **Do the tutorials**
   These tutorials will help you get acquainted with the codebase.

   * [Tracing code](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/ab3TracingCode.html)
   * [Adding a new command](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/ab3AddRemark.html)
   * [Removing fields](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/ab3RemovingFields.html)

## Design

<box type="info" seamless>

**Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams are in this document `docs/diagrams` folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.
</box>

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

</box>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` — Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` — Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` — Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState0.puml" alt="UndoRedoState0" />

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState1.puml" alt="UndoRedoState1" />

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David …​` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState2.puml" alt="UndoRedoState2" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</box>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState3.puml" alt="UndoRedoState3" />


<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</box>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Model" />

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</box>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState4.puml" alt="UndoRedoState4" />

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David …​` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState5.puml" alt="UndoRedoState5" />

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<puml src="diagrams/CommitActivityDiagram.puml" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

### \[Proposed\] Data archiving

_{Explain here how the data archiving feature will be implemented}_


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Documentation, logging, testing, configuration, dev-ops

### Testing

#### Running tests

There are two ways to run tests.

* **Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner**
  * To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
  * To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package,
    test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`
* **Method 2: Using Gradle**
  * Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean test` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean test`)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Link**: Read [this Gradle Tutorial from the se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/gradle.html) to learn more about using Gradle.
</box>

#### Types of tests

This project has three types of tests:

1. *Unit tests* targeting the lowest level methods/classes.<br>
   e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
1. *Integration tests* that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working).<br>
   e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
1. Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together.<br>
   e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`

### DevOps

#### Build automation

This project uses Gradle for **build automation and dependency management**. **You are recommended to read [this Gradle Tutorial from the se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/gradle.html)**.


Given below are how to use Gradle for some important project tasks.


* **`clean`**: Deletes the files created during the previous build tasks (e.g. files in the `build` folder).<br>
  e.g. `./gradlew clean`

* **`shadowJar`**: Uses the ShadowJar plugin to create a fat JAR file in the `build/lib` folder, *if the current file is outdated*.<br>
  e.g. `./gradlew shadowJar`.

* **`run`**: Builds and runs the application.<br>
  **`runShadow`**: Builds the application as a fat JAR, and then runs it.

* **`checkstyleMain`**: Runs the code style check for the main code base.<br>
  **`checkstyleTest`**: Runs the code style check for the test code base.

* **`test`**: Runs all tests.
  * `./gradlew test` — Runs all tests
  * `./gradlew clean test` — Cleans the project and runs tests

#### Continuous integration (CI)

This project uses GitHub Actions for CI. The project comes with the necessary GitHub Actions configurations files (in the `.github/workflows` folder). No further setting up required.

##### Code coverage

As part of CI, this project uses Codecov to generate coverage reports. When CI runs, it will generate code coverage data (based on the tests run by CI) and upload that data to the CodeCov website, which in turn can provide you more info about the coverage of your tests.

However, because Codecov is known to run into intermittent problems (e.g., report upload fails) due to issues on the Codecov service side, the CI is configured to pass even if the Codecov task failed. Therefore, developers are advised to check the code coverage levels periodically and take corrective actions if the coverage level falls below desired levels.

To enable Codecov for forks of this project, follow the steps given in [this se-edu guide](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/codecov.html).

##### Repository-wide checks

In addition to running Gradle checks, CI includes some repository-wide checks. Unlike the Gradle checks which only cover files used in the build process, these repository-wide checks cover all files in the repository. They check for repository rules which are hard to enforce on development machines such as line ending requirements.

These checks are implemented as POSIX shell scripts, and thus can only be run on POSIX-compliant operating systems such as macOS and Linux. To run all checks locally on these operating systems, execute the following in the repository root directory:

`./config/travis/run-checks.sh`

Any warnings or errors will be printed out to the console.

**If adding new checks:**

* Checks are implemented as executable `check-*` scripts within the `.github` directory. The `run-checks.sh` script will automatically pick up and run files named as such. That is, you can add more such files if you need and the CI will do the rest.

* Check scripts should print out errors in the format `SEVERITY:FILENAME:LINE: MESSAGE`
  * SEVERITY is either ERROR or WARN.
  * FILENAME is the path to the file relative to the current directory.
  * LINE is the line of the file where the error occurred and MESSAGE is the message explaining the error.

* Check scripts must exit with a non-zero exit code if any errors occur.

#### Making a release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

1. Update the version number in [`MainApp.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java).
1. Generate a fat JAR file using Gradle (i.e., `gradlew shadowJar`).
1. Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
1. [Create a new release using GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/). Upload the JAR file you created.

### Logging

* We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging.
* The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.
*  The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level.
*  Log messages are output through the console and to a `.log` file.
*  The output logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See the [Configuration guide](#configuration) section).
* **When choosing a level for a log message**, follow the conventions given in [_[se-edu/guides] Java: Logging conventions_](https://se-education.org/guides/conventions/java/logging.html).

### Documentation

**Setting up and maintaining the project website:**

* We use [**MarkBind**](https://markbind.org/) to manage documentation.
* The `docs/` folder contains the source files for the documentation website.
* To learn how to set it up and maintain the project website, follow the guide [[se-edu/guides] Working with Forked MarkBind sites](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/markbind-forked-sites.html).

**Style guidance:**

* Follow the [**_Google developer documentation style guide_**](https://developers.google.com/style).
* Also relevant is the [_se-edu/guides **Markdown coding standard**_](https://se-education.org/guides/conventions/markdown.html).


**Converting to PDF**

* See the guide [_se-edu/guides **Saving web documents as PDF files**_](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/savingPdf.html).

### Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user preferences file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Appendix: Requirements

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* tuition centre tutors
* teaching a wide range of subjects and student levels
* manage students with volatile environment (may sign up or quit midway)
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* can type fast
* prefers typing to mouse interactions
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

**Value proposition**: Tutors often struggle to manage multiple students across different classes, especially when enrollment changes frequently. TutorTrack provides an integrated way to manage both classes and students by:

* Linking each class to its list of enrolled students
* Linking each student to their list of assignments

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. Should work on any _mainstream OS_ as long as it has Java `17` or above installed.
2. Should be able to hold up to 1000 persons without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.
3. A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
4. The product supports only **one user per local data file**; concurrent multi-user access is not expected.
5. All data is stored locally in a **human-readable text file** (e.g., JSON), allowing advanced users to edit it manually.
6. No installer is required — the program can be run directly from a single **JAR file**.
7. The system operates fully offline and has **no dependency on internet connectivity** or remote servers.
8. Platform independence is required; the software must avoid OS-specific libraries so it runs consistently across Windows, macOS, and Linux.
9. Deliverables must be lightweight: the JAR file ≤ **100 MB** and each PDF document ≤ **15 MB** to ensure easy portability and exam usability.
10. Startup time should not exceed **2 seconds** on a modern laptop (e.g., Intel i5/Apple M1 with 8 GB RAM).
11. User commands must execute within **1 second** under typical usage conditions (≤ 1000 students).
12. In the event of a failed storage write, the application must **roll back changes** to prevent data corruption.
13. Data integrity must be preserved across restarts; students and assignments saved before exit should remain consistent on relaunch.
14. On invalid inputs or corrupted files, the program is expected to **fail gracefully** with clear, informative error messages (e.g., “Invalid command format! add: n/NAME p/PARENT_PHONE l/Secondary{1..4}”), without crashing.
15. The user interface must remain usable on screens with at least **1024×768 resolution**, without scrolling needed for core features.
16. Deliverables should exclude unnecessary third-party libraries or oversized media assets, ensuring files are not bloated.

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

Team size: 5

1. **Make accepted phone number formats more flexible and accurate:**
Currently, we accept phone numbers that contain only numbers
and are at least 3 digits long.
We plan to make phone numbers be at least 8 digits long (in Singapore context) and accept formats with
spaces, dashes, or plus signs (e.g., "9123 4567", "912-34567", "+65 91234567").
2. **Make error messages for assign & unassign more cohesive:**
Currently, if we try to assign to a student an assignment belonging to a class
they are not in, we get error message
`Student does not belong to the class group: {class}` but if we do the same for unassign,
we get `Cannot delete non-existent assignment(s): [{assignment} ({class})]`.
We plan to make both error messages follow a similar format, where we check if
the student at INDEX has that class first and show
`Student does not belong to the class group: {class}` straightaway if they do not.
3. **Improve name input validation to detect invalid prefix:**
Currently, we only throw error when user inputs invalid prefixes behind `n/`
prefix with a space between them, e.g., `add n/John Doe a/hw1`, but allow invalid
prefixes when there is no space, e.g., `add n/John Doea/hw1`.
We plan to allow such cases but with an additional warning message to inform
the user of possible invalid prefix if this was unintentional to avoid confusion.
